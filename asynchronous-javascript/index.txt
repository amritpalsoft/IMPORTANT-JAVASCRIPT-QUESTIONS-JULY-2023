JS is synchronous , single-threaded , blocking language

Means it will execute line by line 

So it start using functionalities provided by browser or node , to ask asynchronousally , also called as
browser API's 

So if a piece of code is taking a larger ammount of time to execute , then browser will execute it , 
and javascript will go to next code

                                    //Promise//

Promises are used to deal with asynchronous code in js, it solves the problem of callback-hell
A promise can have 3 states pending, resolve , reject
