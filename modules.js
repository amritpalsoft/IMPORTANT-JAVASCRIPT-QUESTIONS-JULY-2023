// in JS before ES6 there was not mobule system , so it uses common js system
// in common js--> we write const fileName= require("fileName")
// and module.export = fileName

// but ES6 uses , import export statement

// but in Node js , either we have to tell the node to use Type or use '.mjs' system 

// so in package.json --> we have to "type" : "module" or "common"

// nowadays most new packages , dont support common js, so we have to either use .mjs extension or select type in package.json
